As a student, I want to establish a highly visible forum presence for the website mywebclass.org that follows lean and agile principles and facilitates a strong foundation for students to uncover their learning journeys during courses with Professor Williams. So that the goal is to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use platform that allows students to engage in discussions related to their coursework, contribute their own thoughts and questions, and ultimately create a more successful educational experience. By prioritizing the development of the forum features and continually improving them based on user feedback, the project will meet business requirements and ensure long-term success.
